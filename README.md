# Time Series Forecasting of Residential Solar Panel Costs 

## ABSTRACT

The relationship between technology, climate change, and awareness relative to renewable energy creates interesting nuances for the future of the energy sector. Over 1.6 million observations collected from 1998 - 2018 of solar panel installations were used in the project, of which 95% consisted of residential installations. The projectâ€™s model employs univariate ARIMA time series analysis to generate a forecast for a cost_per_watt target variable. The exploratory aspect of the project provided an opportunity to understand time series analysis on a granular level.  

Tech Stack Used: 
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Math, SciPy, StatsModels, Pyramid,  CPI

 
Fun Fact about you or your project:
The data includes over 60 features/columns related to price, taxes/rebate programs, technology, location, manufacturing, install specs etc.
